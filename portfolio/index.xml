Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Rock Paper Scissors Game</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/python-rock-paper-scissors-game/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:13:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/python-rock-paper-scissors-game/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

A data class is a class typically containing mainly data, although there aren’t really any restrictions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With data classes, you don’t have to write boilerplate code to get proper initialization, representation, and comparisons for your objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this course, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define your own data classes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add default values to the fields in your data class&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customize the ordering of data class objects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work with immutable data classes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Why do we use it?</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/why-do-we-use-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:13:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/why-do-we-use-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &amp;lsquo;Content here, content here&amp;rsquo;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &amp;rsquo;lorem ipsum&amp;rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing Your Code With pytest</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/testing-code-pytest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/testing-code-pytest/</guid><description>&lt;p>Testing your code brings a wide variety of benefits. It increases your confidence that the code behaves as you expect and ensures that changes to your code won’t cause regressions. Writing and maintaining tests is hard work, so you should leverage all the tools at your disposal to make it as painless as possible. pytest is one of the best tools you can use to boost your testing productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this video course, you’ll learn:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Django User Management System</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/building-django-user-management-system/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/building-django-user-management-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you’re building your own Django applications, you might decide to extend them with user accounts. In this video course, you’ll learn how to work with Django user management and add it to your program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of this video course, you’ll be able to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create an application where users can register, log in, and reset and change passwords on their own&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Edit the default Django templates responsible for user management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Send password reset emails to actual email addresses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Authenticate using an external service&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You may find it useful to complete Get Started With Django: Build a Portfolio App before beginning this course. However, you can also apply Django user management to any Django apps that you’ve created.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where can I get some?</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/where-can-i-get-some/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/where-can-i-get-some/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don&amp;rsquo;t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where does it come from?</title><link>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/where-does-it-come-from/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arberiatheme.netlify.app/portfolio/where-does-it-come-from/</guid><description>&lt;p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &amp;ldquo;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&amp;rdquo; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &amp;ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&amp;rdquo;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
